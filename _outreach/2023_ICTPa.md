The scope of this workshop is twofold. Firstly, it seeks to equip early career scientists and science students, particularly from groups that are underrepresented in physics and related STEM areas, with tools that are necessary for the advancement in their careers. Secondly, it seeks to discuss the difficulties that members of these underrepresented groups face during their careers, and define strategies that can help reduce existing gaps. To this end, we will address the gender gap in STEM in combination with other categories such as ethnicity, sexual orientation and geographical location. The goal is to reorganize the scientific ecosystem to make it more inclusive and diverse. This is important not only because it constitutes a basic human right, but also because the great challenges that humanity faces require the joint effort of people of different backgrounds, viewpoints, and experiences.
