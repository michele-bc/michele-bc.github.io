The "From Telescope to Discovery: A Scientific Journey Through the Stars" project is a four-month online program from IAG/USP that offers high school students and graduates the opportunity to engage in professional astronomy. Participants will join a virtual class to learn about the scientific method by making remote observations of variable stars using the Meade 16" telescope at the Abrahão de Moraes Observatory. The project is free and aims to democratize access to scientific research, giving priority to students from public schools, low-income backgrounds, and areas with limited access to scientific equipment. The ultimate goal is to allow participants to contribute to a real scientific database and to spark a passion for astronomy.
