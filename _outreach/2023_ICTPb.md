The goal of this workshop is to discuss and present initiatives aimed at increasing the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM careers, with a focus of this 2-day event on Afro-Brazilian, indigenous and low-income populations. This activity will be organized in the form of plenary talks and roundtable discussions, with the first day focusing on initiatives organized in the USA and Argentina, and the second day focusing on initiatives in Brazil. The talks will be in English and Spanish on the first day and Portuguese on the second day. There will also be a discussion session on proposals of concrete actions that could be implemented by ICTP-SAIFR.
