The ASTROMINAS project is an initiative founded in 2019 by women from various scientific and exact sciences institutes, including the Institute of Astronomy, Geophysics and Atmospheric Sciences (IAG/USP). Its primary mission is to facilitate access for young female students to university and to encourage them to pursue careers in Science and Technology. The project accomplishes this by connecting these students with female scientists, which helps to dismantle the belief that the exact sciences are not suitable for girls. Beyond career choices, ASTROMINAS believes that knowledge of the Earth and the universe is crucial for a well-rounded education and for empowering girls to be engaged citizens. The project uses astronomy, an inherently interdisciplinary field, as an entry point to teach students about various scientific areas. Through this work, ASTROMINAS aims to help girls develop scientific skills, fostering a sense of belonging in the scientific community and working toward gender equality in science.
