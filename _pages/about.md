Hi there!     
     
      
I am an Astrophysics PhD candidate at Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul. I work with trying to understand the interplay between Active Galactic Nuclei activity and circumnuclear star formation via near-infrared spectral synthesis. But I am also very interested in the Extragalactic/Galactic interface to better understand the observational and theoretical constraints underlying the spectral synthesis.

I am actively involved in women in science and outreach projects. I maintain two websites (both are in Portuguese):  

- **[Mulheres em Astro & Física](https://michele-bc.github.io/mulheres-astroefisica/) (Women in Astro & Physics)**, which features a collection of women who have made significant contributions to physics and astronomy/astrophysics, aimed at being incorporated into classroom discussions.  
- **[Estudos de Astro](https://sites.google.com/view/estudos-de-astrofisica) (Astro Studies)**, which includes my study notes, class assignments, and annotations for the courses I have prepared.

**SMARTY**


<div align="justify">

SMARTY is our near-infrared (NIR) stellar library, an acronym for the MILES Moderate Resolution Near-Infrared Stellar Library. We selected 31 stars from the MILES optical library (which have well-defined atmospheric parameters) and provide broad coverage of the HR diagram. We observed the stars with the Gemini Near-IR Spectrograph (GNIRS) at the 8.1 m Gemini North telescope, achieving a resolution of R ~ 1300. Ground observations in the NIR are very challenging because most of the Earth's atmospheric emissions are located in these wavelengths, so delivering reliable spectra requires a lot of procedures. For SMARTY, we applied different methods to ensure good-quality spectra, and we made them available to the community. You can access it [here](https://www.if.ufrgs.br/~riffel/smarty/)!
