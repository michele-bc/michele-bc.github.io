Hi there!

I am an Astrophysics PhD candidate at Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul. I work with trying to understand the interplay between Active Galactic Nuclei activity and circumnuclear star formation via near-infrared spectral synthesis. I am mainly interested in the Extragalactic/Galactic interface to better understand the observational and theoretical constraints on the spectral synthesis.

**SMARTY**

We have ensembled a near infrared (NIR) stellar library called SMARTY: The MILES moderate resolution near-infrared stellar library. We selected 31 stars of the MILES optical library, which have well-defined atmospheric parameters, and presented a broad coverage of the HR diagram. We observed the stars with the Gemini Near-IR Spectrograph (GNIRS) at the 8.1 m Gemini North telescope, with resolution of R~1300. Our goal was make SMARTY available to the community, and you can access [here](https://www.if.ufrgs.br/~riffel/smarty/).
