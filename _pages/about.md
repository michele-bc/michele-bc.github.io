Hi there!

I am an Astrophysics PhD student at Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul. I work with trying to understand the interplay between Active Galactic Nuclei activity and circumnuclear star formation via near-infrared spectral synthesis. I am mainly interested in the Extragalactic/Galactic interface to better understand the observational and theoretical constraints on the spectral synthesis.
